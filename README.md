# Chatbot
I have build a working chatbot with the help of python using gemini pro api

Now explore the new insights of our project and make it more useful in your life

I have also made an virtual environment for this by writing python -m venv venv in the command palette

For activating  virtual environment I use the command venv\Scripts\activate

To deactivate write deactivate

To run the code with the help of streamlit we use streamlit run chat.py in the command palette

Now I will show you the demo that how my chatbot will work
